Customer Support Chat - Issue Escalation
==========================================

[Customer] John Smith - 10:15 AM
Hi, I'm having a major issue with my order #ORD-2024-7891. The payment went through but I haven't received any confirmation email. This is urgent as I need this for a client meeting tomorrow.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:16 AM
I've been trying to reach someone for 2 hours now. This is completely unacceptable service.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:18 AM
I'm a premium customer with 3 years of history. Never had this problem before. Really disappointed.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:20 AM
Can someone please respond? I'm about to cancel my subscription and switch to your competitor.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:25 AM
This is ridiculous. I've spent over $50,000 with your company this year alone. Is this how you treat your best customers?

[Customer] John Smith - 10:30 AM
I'm posting about this on LinkedIn and Twitter. This is going to damage your reputation.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:35 AM
I need this resolved in the next 30 minutes or I'm filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:40 AM
I've already contacted my lawyer. This is breach of contract. You charged me but didn't deliver the service.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:45 AM
Last chance. Either fix this now or I'm going public with this entire conversation.

[Customer] John Smith - 10:50 AM
I'm done waiting. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced. You've lost a customer forever.
